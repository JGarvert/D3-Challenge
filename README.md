# D3-Challenge
Unit 16 homework on D3

## Background:

The purpose of this project is use new D3 knowledge to analyze and create a chart (somewhat interactive) of the data below.

Data provided with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.  It set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

Started code was provided that included the index.html, d3Style.css, style.css, data.csv, and .eslintrc.json.

## Technologies:
Becuase the homework came with many files (and technologies) already included, the challenge was to complete the app.js file.  (e.g. technologies were already included.)

## Steps for completion:
Create a scatter from two of the data variables with each circle representing a state.  Include state abbreviations in the circles and make sure the axis are labeled, situated on the bottom and left, and look reasonable.
